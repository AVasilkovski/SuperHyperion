feat: enforce Programmatic Epistemology (Phase 16.2 Complete)

Establishes the "Epistemic Law" baseline for valid theory change operation,
lane governance, and evidence semantics.

1. Evidence Semantics (Phase 16.1):
   - Implements strict `validation-evidence` vs `negative-evidence` types.
   - Enforces scope-lock and template-qid presence in payloads.
   - Adds `EvidenceRole` enum (SUPPORT, REFUTE, UNDERCUT, REPLICATE).

2. Theory Change Operator (Phase 16.2):
   - Implements `TheoryChangeOperator` for deterministic proposal generation.
   - Adds conflict scoring and auto-decision logic (REVISE/FORK/HOLD).
   - Wires `OntologySteward` to aggregate evidence and stage proposals.

3. Governance & Invariants:
   - Centralizes policy in `IntentRegistry` (Normative Spec).
   - Enforces strict Lane Governance (Grounded=HITL, Speculative=Auto).
   - Hardens `IntentService` against payload drift (e.g. `lane` in envelope).

4. Verification:
   - Adds full regression suite (344 tests passing).
   - Fixes all CLI and Service regressions via mocked registry.

Breaking Change:
- `validate_intent_payload` now strictly rejects unauthorized fields.
- `validation-evidence` TypeQL requires strict ID references.
