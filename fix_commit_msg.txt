fix: move logging init to main block and verify schema

- Moves `logging.basicConfig` in `src/api/main.py` out of global scope to prevent "logging already initialized" errors during tests.
- Verified `src/schema/scientific_knowledge.tql`: `validation-evidence` correctly inherits `entity-id` from `evidence` and does not redeclare it. No duplicate definitions found.
